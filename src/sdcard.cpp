// The Waveshare schematic's SD-CARD block labels the socket pins CMD/CLK/D0/D3 (generic
// microSD naming) but wires only the four SPI-mode lines to the ESP32: CMD->MOSI,
// CLK->SCK, D0->MISO, D3->CS (D1/D2/card-detect are not connected). So this is a plain
// SPI card, not SD_MMC, even though the silkscreen uses SD_MMC-style pin names.
// The pins live in config.h, per board. The Big Orb drives its SDMMC socket the same way,
// in SPI mode, so this file and every SD.open() in the tree stay board-agnostic.
